# TestRepository
This is the repo for the coding test question responses as requested.  It is a NetBeans project.  I have never upladed a Java project to GitHub, so apologies if it doesn't work out of the box.

No license is provided; should any intrepid soul outside of the pertinent personnel find this repo, they have no right to use it.
In fact, this repo will be made private or removed as soon as it's feasible.

A few things:
The project is designed as a console application - running Main will execute the collection and sequential number printing answers.

-CollectionExercise contains the solutions to part 2

-DotNumberPrinter contains the solution to part 3

-Turns out, ellipses are complicated.  Who knew?

I wasn't always clear on the wording/directions but considering this is the first java I've written since 2010, I'm pretty happy about this.
